**themap-tools** is a package for analysis of peptide-HLA presentation and TCR specificity. It is designed to help researchers understand the interactions between T cell receptors (TCRs) and peptides presented by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules, which play a crucial role in the immune response.

## Installation
It is available on PyPI and can be installed using pip:
```bash
pip install themap-tools
```
or by cloning the repository and installing it manually:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/uhlerlab/themap-tools.git@main
