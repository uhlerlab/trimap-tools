To predict TCR specificity using trimap-tools, the first step involves learning latent representations for both HLA and peptide sequences. Users can either utilize the datasets we provide or train on their own custom data. We also provide pre-trained model weights for HLA and peptide encoders, which can be directly loaded and used without retraining. Once the representations are ready, users can perform downstream predictions of TCR specificity with high efficiency and accuracy.
